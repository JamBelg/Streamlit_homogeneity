Testing homogeneity using Anova test

This application provides a tool for testing homogeneity of data across multiple variables using ANOVA, Levene, and Bartlett tests.\
It allows users to upload a CSV file or use sample data to analyze the homogeneity and identify outliers using various methods like Z-score, IQR, and Isolation Forest.\
The tool offers interactive visualizations, including boxplots, Z-score plots, and Q-Q plots, to help users understand the data distribution and variance. Additionally, users can easily remove detected outliers and explore detailed test results to assess group uniformity.
